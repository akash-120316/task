 Beginner-level Java problem statements that involve the use of `for` loops and `if` statements:
 ### 1. Print Even Numbers
 **Problem:**
 Write a Java program that prints all even numbers between 1 and 50.
 **Hint:** Use a `for` loop to iterate from 1 to 50 and an `if` statement to check if a number is
 even.
 ### 2. Sum of Multiples of 5
 **Problem:**
 Write a Java program that calculates and prints the sum of all multiples of 5 between 1 and 100.
 **Hint:** Use a `for` loop to iterate from 1 to 100 and an `if` statement to check if a number is a
 multiple of 5.
 ### 3. Prime Number Checker
 **Problem:**
 Write a Java program that checks if a given number is prime. A prime number is a number that
 is only divisible by 1 and itself.
 **Hint:** Use a `for` loop to iterate from 2 to the square root of the number and an `if` statement
 to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself.
 ### 4. Fibonacci Series
 **Problem:**
 Write a Java program that prints the first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci series. The Fibonacci
 series is a sequence where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0
 and 1.
 **Hint:** Use a `for` loop to generate the series and `if` statements to handle the first two
 numbers separately.
 ### 5. Count and Sum of Positive and Negative Numbers
 **Problem:**
Write a Java program that takes 10 integers from the user and counts how many are positive
 and how many are negative. Additionally, calculate the sum of positive and negative numbers
 separately.
 **Hint:** Use a `for` loop to take 10 inputs and `if` statements to classify and sum the numbers.
 ### 6. Find the Largest and Smallest Number
 **Problem:**
 Write a Java program that takes 5 integers from the user and finds the largest and smallest
 numbers among them.
 **Hint:** Use a `for` loop to take 5 inputs and `if` statements to keep track of the largest and
 smallest numbers.
 ### 7. Sum of Digits
 **Problem:**
 Write a Java program that takes an integer from the user and calculates the sum of its digits.
 **Hint:** Use a `while` loop to extract digits and an `if` statement to check the termination
 condition.
 ### 8. Number Guessing Game
 **Problem:**
 Write a Java program that generates a random number between 1 and 100. The user has to
 guess the number. For each guess, the program should indicate whether the guess is too high,
 too low, or correct. The game continues until the user guesses the correct number.
 **Hint:** Use a `for` loop to limit the number of guesses and `if` statements to give feedback on
 each guess
